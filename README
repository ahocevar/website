The .shtml files in this directory are Apache server-parsed HTML files. Using
server-side includes allows us to have a standard header and footer for all
the pages on the site. This requires having Apache load mod_include, and
then the following configuration is required in the VirtualHost:

    Options +Includes
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
    DirectoryIndex index.cgi index.shtml index.html

At present, loading mod_include causes a weird interaction with Trac, which is
fixed by adding the following to the Trac VirtualHost:

    ErrorDocument 401 default

The Apache server on openlayers.org is (naturally) currently configured this
way.

Find the checkout of this directory at /osgeo/openlayers/docs on the 
openlayers.org machine.  The checkout is updated by a cron job that runs the
update_dev_dir.sh script.
